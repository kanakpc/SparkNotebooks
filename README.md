# hello-world
=============

This is my first repository project for trying out GitHub. 
This change is to let you know that I can do magic in SQL.

This is the 1st attempt to create a branch locally and save/sync changes locally and on GitHub eventually.

This is teh 2nd change to the file for trying out things.
